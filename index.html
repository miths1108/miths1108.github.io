					 <h4>M.E. Course Projects</h4>
					 <ul>					 
						<li>Feature Mining for Similarity Search <font color = #999> (Topics in Database Systems, Spring 2015) </font> 
							<br>
							<font color = #999 size = 2.8 em>  The project's goal is to mine interesting/rare features (set of attributes that makes an object (possesing it) standout). An interesting feature is simply an attributes combination that is present much lower than the expectation. Henceforth, these features can help in drawing similary between objects of interest. </font>
						</li><br>
						<li>Cooperative Game Theory for Information Difussion <font color = #999> (Game Theory, Spring 2015) </font> 
						<br>
							<font color = #999 size = 2.8 em>  In this project, we studied several information diffusion models (independent cascade, linear threshold and decreasing cascade) and simulated the algorithms for influnce maximization on these models. The algorithms implemented in this project were the KKT greedy algorithm and the Shapley value algorithm. Also, this project introduced a new class of information diffusion models (named evolutionary models).</font>
						</li> <br>
						<li>Ensemble Learning Methods and Application on Face Detection <font color = #999> (Machine Learning, Spring 2015) </font> 
						<br>
							<font color = #999 size = 2.8 em>  This project gives a comparative study of two popular ensemble techniques, viz. Bagging and AdaBoost. For comparision, decision trees, decision stump, SVM and perceptron were picked as weak learners. Also, we studied the limitations of AdaBoost and explored an improved technique called the FloadBoost algorithm. Lastly, the project includes a small face detection application which uses the Viola-Jones technique (based on AdaBoosting). </font>
						</li> <br>

						<li>Automatic Schema Detection from  SQL Query Workload <font color = #999> (DBMS, Fall 2014) </font> 
						<br>
							<font color = #999 size = 2.8 em>  This project gives an approach to generate schema from the given set of queries. The generated schema includes information about the table-column mapping, datatype of columns, primary-key foreign-key relationship and dimension table fact table. We have verified the effectiveness of our algorithm by running it on TPC-H query benchmark and comparing the output with the original schema.</font>
						</li>
					 </ul>
					 <p class="cmpny1"></p> <br>
					  <h4>B.Tech Projects</h4>
					 <ul>					 
						<li>Gandharv <font color = #999> (Major Project, 2013-14) </font> 
							<br>
							<font color = #999 size = 2.8 em>   This project provides a tool that gives collaborative environment for music enthusiasts, which can assist in effective and efficient music composition. Project details are available <a href = "http://miths1108.github.io/Gandharv/"> here </a>. </font>
						</li><br>
						<li>Analogical Reasoning: Significance and Application in Design Problem Solving <font color = #999> (Problem Solving and Research Methodology, Spring 2014) </font> 
						<br>
							<font color = #999 size = 2.8 em>  In this project, we studied in depth about analogical reasoning and its significance. Typically we studied its role in the field of education. Also, we proposed a taxonomy on the applications of analogical reasoning in design problem solving. Lastly, we also identified certain drawbacks of analogical reasoning and explored alternatives for it.</font>
						</li> <br>
						<li>Activity Analysis in School <font color = #999> (Human Computer Interaction, Fall 2013) </font> 
						<br>
							<font color = #999 size = 2.8 em>  This project was a field-work where we went to a school (Eicher School, Faridabad) and studied various activities that take place in different depts. We focused ourselves to Accounts Section and Academics Section. Our aim was to design activity systems for different activities that take place in these sections and also explore the ways in which we can automate these activities. </font>
						</li> <br>

						<li>Mining Wikipedia Revision History <font color = #999> (Minor Project II, Spring 2013) </font> 
						<br>
							<font color = #999 size = 2.8 em>  This project had two objectives: (i) to model editors' lifetime, and (ii) design a recommendation system for the editors. We used the technique of survival analysis to investigate how long Wikipedia editors remain active in editing. Then the system recommended the editors the top pages on the basis of his domain that he 
might like to edit. For this, we implemented the algorithm of LDA.</font>
						</li> <br>

						<li>Hide<font color = #999> (Multimedia Lab, Spring 2013) </font> 
						<br>
							<font color = #999 size = 2.8 em>In this project, we built a one player-five stages game using Adobe Flash. Every stage had a greater difficulty level. Each level was time based and in addition the player had three lives in total to complete the game.</font>
						</li><br>

						<li>Sync'n'Share <font color = #999> (Minor Project I, Fall 2012) </font> 
						<br>
							<font color = #999 size = 2.8 em>  A distributed file syncing and sharing application where a dedicated folder is created at every node and all the files present in it are synced on the application server. These can then also be shared with other nodes. In addition, it has a web interface which also provides a collaborative file editing feature. The project is available <a href = "https://github.com/miths1108/Sync-N-Share"> here </a>.</font>
						</li> </ul>

					  <h4>Other Projects</h4>
					 <ul>					 
						<li>Interactive Online Experimets on Refraction <font color = #999> (Ekshiksha Physics Laboratory, IIT Bombay, 2013) </font> 
							<br>
							<font color = #999 size = 2.8 em>   This project was a part of the <a href = "http://www.ekshiksha.org.in/">Ekshiksha Physics Laboratory, IIT Bombay </a>. As a part of this project, I developed five interative online experiments that covered various concepts of <i> Refraction of Light</i>. </font>
						</li><br>
						<li>Online Web Design and HTML Editor <font color = #999> (2012) </font> 
						<br>
							<font color = #999 size = 2.8 em>  In this project, I developed an online client-side web design and HTML editor using javascript. The project is available <a href = "https://github.com/miths1108/Web-Design-and-HTML-Editor">here</a>.</font>
						</li> <br>

						<li>JVEdit <font color = #999> (2011) </font>
